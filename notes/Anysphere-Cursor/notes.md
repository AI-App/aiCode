# Anysphere Cursor: notes

- 2026.02: on Ubuntu, crashes quite often, perhaps due to Ubuntu's inferior memory management

- 2026.02: on Windows, still has annoying bugs that keep changing line endings every now and then

- 2025.11: EXCELLENT at tracing and understanding rules
  - able to trace symlinked directories and files
    to find rules there
